# Instructions for reproducability

All the code is within the `src` folder as a IPython notebook.

All efforts for this project was developed within Google Colaboratory, as even with Conda setting up
CUDA drivers and setting up proper dependency management was quite a hassle, especially when testing across
different platforms and machines. Use the badge below, in order to open up the project and reproduce
